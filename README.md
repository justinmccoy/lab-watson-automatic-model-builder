## 3. Create a project in Watson Studio and upload training data
A project is how you organize your resources to achieve a particular goal. Your project resources can include data, collaborators, and analytic assets like notebooks and models. Projects depends on a connection to object storage to store assets. Each project has a separate bucket to hold the project's assets. 


1. From the Watson Studio dashboard getting started display, click on `Create Project`, or `New Project` 

  ![](doc/source/images/new-project.png?raw=true)

2. Select project type. There are many different tools built into Watson Studio and multiple views are built to simplify the features shown to users.  Select the `Standard Project` where all features are available, and click `Create Project`.

  ![](doc/source/images/standard-project.png?raw=true)
  
3. Watson Studio projects depend on Object Storage for storing project assets such as notebooks, models, and data. These project assets are created in a project specific bucket within object storage.  If you don't already have Object Storage defined you can create a new instance of the service directly from the New Project dialog. Under `Define storage` select `Add`. In the Cloud Object Storage service creation menu, accept the default options, select `Lite` and then `Create`.  

**Note:**  You cannot define two Object Storage services under the free tier of IBM Cloud; if you already have object storage defined, choose `Existing` as highlighted in the screenshot below.

  ![](doc/source/images/create-services.png?raw=true)
  
  
  ![](doc/source/images/create-services-cos.png?raw=true)
  
  
4. With object storage created, or existing object storage linked, click `Refresh` allowing Watson Studio to discover the newly created service. Enter _Watson ML Demo_ as the project name and click `Create`.

5. From within the new project's `Overview` panel, click `Add to project` on the top right, selecting `Data asset`.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-to-project.png?raw=true)

  A panel on the right of the screen appears, select `Load` and click on `Browse` to upload the data file you'll use to create a predictive model.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-data-asset.png?raw=true)

6. On your machine, browse to the location of the file [**patientdataV6.csv**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinmccoy/predictive-model-on-watson-ml/master/data/patientdataV6.csv) in this repository in the **data/** directory. Select the file and click on Open (or the equivalent action for your operating system).

Once successfully uploaded, the file should appear in the `Data Assets` section of `Assets`.

  ![](doc/source/images/data-assets.png?raw=true)

Congratulations, you've created a new Machine Learning Project and uploaded training data.

## 4. Create an instance of the Watson Machine Learning Service and associate it to project

Machine Learning is a service on IBM Cloud with features for training and deploying machine learning models and neural networks:

* Interfaces for building, training, and deploying models: [Python client library](https://wml-api-pyclient.mybluemix.net/), [Command line interface](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_environment.html), [REST API](https://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/)
* Deployment infrastructure for hosting your trained models
* Hyperparameter optimization for training complex neural networks
* Distributed deep learning for distributing training runs across multiple servers
* GPUs for faster training

In this lab we're using the Automatic Model Builder, a feature of the Watson Machine Learning Service. The Automatic Model Builder guides you, step by step, through building a model that uses popular machine learning algorithms. Just upload your training data, and then let the model builder automatically prepare your data and recommend techniques that suit your data.

1. Click on `Settings` for the project, then `Add Service` under `Associate Services` and finally, select `Watson` to add a Watson service to the project.  Note there are several types of servcies we can assoicate with a project, including Dashboards, and connections to existing Apache Spark services.

  ![](doc/source/images/settings.png?raw=true)

2. Select `Machine Learning` from the list of available Watson Services.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-associated-service.png?raw=true)

**Note:** If you have an existing Machine Learning service select your `Existing` service instead of creating a new one.

  ![](doc/source/images/choose-ml-service.png?raw=true)
  
3. Verify this service is being created in the `Dallas region`.

  ![](doc/source/images/watson-ml-create.png?raw=true)

4. Click `Create`.

The Watson Machine Learning service is now listed as one of your `Associated Services`. 

## 5. Explore the Data
Before diving into the training of a machine learning model it's important to understand how your data is structured, what fields are available, if there is any missing data, and potentially any data that might not be useful that could be removed.  A quick way to preview data is with Data Refinery, a visual data exploration tool built into Watson Studio.

1. From the *Watson ML Demo* project page in Watson Studio, select the `Assets` tab then the `Refine` action to load the patient data into Data Refinery.

 ![](doc/source/images/load-data-refinery.png?raw=true)

2. Understand the quality and distribution of your data using data profiler, and dozens of built-in charts, graphs, and statistics. Automatically detect data types and column classifications. Explore the data, selecting the `Profile` tab to better understand the values for the columns or features used later when building the machine learning models.

 #### Data Refinery Overview

 #### Data Refinery Data Profile
 ![](doc/source/images/data-refinery-profile.png?raw=true)
 
3. Don't spend too long exploring data during this lab, there's still a lot more to do!


## 6. Train a Machine Learning model
The Automatic Model Builder tool in Watson Studio, backed by the Watson Machine Learning Service simplifies two fundamental operations of machine learning: training and scoring.

*Training* is the process of refining an algorithm so that it can learn from a data set. The output of this operation is called a model. A model encompasses the learned coefficients of mathematical expressions.

*Scoring* is the operation of predicting an outcome by using a trained model. The output of the scoring operation is another data set containing predicted values.

Let's create a machine learning pipeline that leverages data transformations and machine learning algorithms to train several models and evaluate their accuracy; all without writing any code.


1. Starting from the `Assets` tab of our Watson Studio Project *Watson ML Demo*, select `Add to Project` and `Model`

  ![](doc/source/images/add-model-to-project.png?raw=true)
  
2. Within the *New Model* dialog, name the model *Heart Failure Prediction Model*, select the runtime that will be used for building a data pipeline, and training.  The `Default Spark Scala 2.11` environment should be used, and will consume 1.5 capacity units per hour of training. 

Select `Manual` to define the evaluator algorithms, they type of model to train, and how to split training and validation data.

  ![](doc/source/images/create-model.png?raw=true)

**Note:** Alternate environments or Apache Spark runtimes can be used for training.
  
3. Click `Create`, to begin training and evaluating.

4. Select your training dataset and click `Next`

  ![](doc/source/images/select-training-data.png?raw=true)

5. Configure how the Machine Learning Model is trained, and what data is used in the training. Before moving onto the next step there are several basic machine learning terms, best practices, and conventions to understand. First it's important to understand our data, what it represents, it's format, and what we're trying to predict.

  ![](doc/source/images/configure-amb.png?raw=true)
  
  
  1. **Selecting a Label Column** - The Label Column is what we would like to predict. In this usecase we are trying to predict if someone is at risk of heartrate failure or not. Looking at the data from previous steps we know there's a *HEARTRATEFAILURE* column and it's represented by a string value of *Y* or *N* for each sample.  Select `HEARTRATEFAILURE`, as it's what we're trying to predict.
  2. **Selecting Feature Columns** - The Feature Column(s), are what fields in each sample are used to make a prediction. From previous steps we identified several columns in our dataset that represent different *Features* of each sample that might influence if a patient is at risk of heartrate failure. Here the Automatic Model Builder tool will default to selecting all columns, excluding the `Label Column` of `HEARTRATEFAILURE` to use in making a prediction.
  3. **Selecting Model Type** - The Automatic Model Builder simplifies *Classification* and *Regression* tasks, where *classification* builds a model to predict a discreate class, and *Regression* builds a model to predict a continious value. Since we're trying to predict either *Y* someone is at risk of heartrate failure or *N* someone is not at risk of heartrate failure we're working on a `Binary Classification` task, where the prediction can either be 0 or 1. Based on the `Label Column` selected, the Automatic Model Builder will have already selected `Binary Classification` for use in training.
  4. **Validation Split** - Training machine learning models is an iterative process and the data used to train a model should not be used when evaluating the accuracy of a model, as data used in training is already known and has shaped how the model formed. Validation of a models accuracy depends on usage of data the model has never seen before.  This step splits up all of our data setting some asside for training, test, and eventually validation. A common division of this data is usually 60% Training, 20% Test, and 20% validation.  The Automatic Model Builder has already set these defaults.
  5. **Estimators** - The machine learning algorithms used for finding the best fit of `Features` to `Label` are estimators.  These estimators are hardest part of machine learning, and finding the right one depends on the input data and type of problem, regression, classification, clustering, or dimensionality reduction. With the Automatic Model Builder we can select several different *estimators* and compare their accuracy on the problem of predicting heartrate failure. 
  
6. Click on `Add Estimators`, and select the 4 available: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier.

  ![](doc/source/images/select-estimator.png?raw=true)
  
7. The Automatic Model Builder is now configured and ready to run, click `Next`

  ![](doc/source/images/amb-configured.png?raw=true)
  
8. Evaluate the effectiveness of each model. Models are compared for accuracy by the *Area Under ROC Curve*, and the *Area under PR Curve*, where the higher the value the more accurate the model. The ROC Curve is calculated by comparing the *True Positive* rate vs the *False Positive Rate*.  The precision-recall (PR) Curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different threshold. A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate. High scores for both show that the classifier is returning accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of all positive results (high recall).  

For our task of predicting heartrate failure, we want high percision with a low false positive, false negative rate.  Unfortunally with the data we have we're about 60% accurate with high percision using a Random Forest Classifier.


Select the trained model that has the highest *Area Under PR Curve* and click `Save`

![](doc/source/images/amb-evaluation.png?raw=true)

9. Congratulations, you've trained and evaluated a machine learning model without writing any code!

#### Model View
![](doc/source/images/model-saved.png?raw=true)

**Note:** Your model will have different results and accuracy due to the randomness of spliting up the training and evaluation data.


## 7. Deploy Machine Learning Model as a Web Service

Although training is a critical step in the machine learning process, the model still needs to be packaged, fronted with an API, and deployed as a web service. Watson Machine Learning streamlines deployment of machine learning model into production.

1. Starting from the *Watson ML Demo* project view in Watson Studio, an additional asset has been added to the project. The newly trained and saved *Heart Failure Prediction Model* is now visible.

![](doc/source/images/project-view.png?raw=true)

2. Select the `Heart Failure Prediction Model` asset from the project view, then select `Deployments` from the model view, and finally select `Add Deployment`. 

![](doc/source/images/model-view.png?raw=true)

3. Name the deployment *Heart Failure Prediction Model Deployment* of the trained machine learning model, for packaging, and fronting with an API, and click `Save`.

![](doc/source/images/model-deploy.png?raw=true)

4. The model is quickly packaged and deployed. Upon completion you will have a new deployment of the trained machine learning model; every trained model can have many deployments.

![](doc/source/images/model-deploy-success.png?raw=true)

5. Double click on the deployed *Heart Failure Prediction Model Deployment* to see details of the deployed model in the `Overview` tab.  In addition to the details there are two additional tabs, one `Implementation`, and another `Test`.  The `Implementation` tab provides you with sample code for invoking the API from `cURL`, `Python`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, or `Scala`. 

#### Model deployment details

#### Model API implementation details
![](doc/source/images/model-deploy-implementation.png?raw=true)

#### Sample test invoking deployed Model
![](doc/source/images/model-deploy-test.png?raw=true)


6. Obtain Watson Machine Learning Credentials needed for invoking APIs. The Watson Machine Learning service was created and runs on IBM Cloud. To get the Watson Machine Learning credentials access the IBM Cloud Dashboad by selecting the *Hambuger Menu* in the upper left corner and click `Dashboard`.

![](doc/source/images/ibm-cloud-menu.png?raw=true)



7. Back at the IBM Cloud Dashboard, you will be able to see all the services created during this lab.  Click on the `Watson Machine Learning Service`. 

**Note:** Your service name will vary
 
![](doc/source/images/ibm-cloud-dashboard.png?raw=true)

8. From within the Watson Machine Learning Service details, select `Service Credentials` from the left menu.  Click on `View Credentials` and copy the credentials for the Watson Machine Learning Service.

![](doc/source/images/wml-save-credentials.png?raw=true)



### 8. Deploy a Node.js test application in Cloud Foundry Runtime
Until this point in the lab, we've been working as a data scientist and data engineer, gathering data, exploring data, building models, and evaluating models. In this section of the lab we deploy an existing Node.js application that has been developed to call a Machine Learning Model deployed as `Heart Failure Prediction Model Deployment` without having to explicitly specify the Watson Machine Learning credentials in the application.  This 

1. Click on the `IBM Cloud` button below to open create a new DevOps toolchain, that is configured to download the existing Node.js application from this repo, package it, and deploy it as a new Node.js Cloud Foundry Application in IBM Cloud.

  [![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/justinmccoy/predictive-model-on-watson-ml)

**Note:**  Make sure to deploy the application to the same region and space as where the *Watson Machine Learning* service was created.

2. Create a short, unique name for the toolchain; this will also be the hostname of your app. Next click on `Create` to create a new IBM Cloud API Key, and finally click on `Deploy` to deploy the application.

  ![](doc/source/images/pipeline.png?raw=true)
  
**Note:** It may take a minute for the remaining fields to automatically fill in after creating the IBM Cloud API Key.

3. A Toolchain and Delivery Pipeline will be created for you to pull the app out of Github and deploy it in to IBM Cloud. Click on the `Delivery Pipeline` tile to see the status of the deployment.

  ![](doc/source/images/toolchain.png?raw=true)

4. Wait for the **Deploy Stage** to complete successfully; should take less then 5 minutes.

  ![](doc/source/images/deploy-stage.png?raw=true)

5. Click on the *Hamburger Menu* and return to the IBM Cloud Dashboard, and double click on the newly deployed `Cloud Foundry Application`

  
  ![](doc/source/images/ibm-cloud-menu.png?raw=true)
  
  Select `Dashboard`
  
  ![](doc/source/images/open-cf-app.png?raw=true)
  
6. For our newly deployed Node.js app to communicate with the Watson Machine Learning Service without having to explicitly set credentials, a new connection between the app and service needs to be created. From within the Cloud Foundry App View select `Connections` and then `Create Connection`.

  ![](doc/source/images/cf-app-view.png?raw=true)

7. Select the `Watson Machine Learning Service`, and click `Connect`. Answer `Restage` to the prompt. Restaging the Node.js app, will ensure the app has access to the Watson Machine Learning credentials. 

![](doc/source/images/cf-app-connect.png?raw=true)

Click `Restage`
![](doc/source/images/cf-app-restage.png?raw=true)

8. With the app restaged, and the model deployed go ahead and visit the App URL and test your deployed machine learning model from a Node.js web app.

![](doc/source/images/cf-app-url.png?raw=true)
