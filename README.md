#  Create and deploy a scoring model to predict heart failure on IBM Cloud with Watson Studio

In this Code Pattern, we will use the Automatic Model Builder on Watson Studio to build a predictive model that demonstrates a potential health care use case.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model using the Watson Automatic Model Builder
* Deploy the model to IBM's Watson Machine Learning service
* Access the Machine Learning model via either APIs or a Node.js app

![](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

## Flow
1. The developer creates a Watson Studio Service
2. Use the Automatic Model Builder to build, train, and evaluate a model; part of the Watson Machine Learning Service
3. Watson Studio uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data and project files 
4. Watson Machine Learning Service depends on an Apache Spark service for model training
5. Import data on heart failure
6. Trained models are deployed into production using Watson Machine Learning Service
7. A Node.js web app is deployed on IBM Cloud calling the predictive model hosted in the Watson Machine Learning Service
8. A user visits the web app, enters their information, and the predictive model returns a response

## Prerequisites

* An [IBM Cloud Account](https://console.bluemix.net)

* A space in IBM Cloud US South or United Kingdom regions.

As of 2/5/2018, the Machine Learning service on IBM Cloud is only available in the US South or United Kingdom regions.

### 1. Create an instance of the Watson Studio Service
Watson Studio is your IDE for Machine Learning and Data Science, combining opensource tools, and libraries into a unified Cloud based platform for discovering and sharing insights. For this lab we're using the Automatic Model Builder simplifying the data preparation, training, and evaluation steps of machine learning. 

* In your browser go to the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps) and click `Catalog`. 

* In the navigation menu at the left, select `AI` and then select `Watson Studio`.

  ![](doc/source/images/watson-studio-service.png?raw=true)

* Verify this service is being created in the Dallas region, and you've selected the lite/free pricing plan. Note the lite/free plan only allows you to add a single user to your project, and is limited in the compute capacity hours.  More details on limites and to monitor usage is available in the (documentation)[https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/admin/monitor-resources.html?context=analytics&linkInPage=true}.

  ![](doc/source/images/watson-studio-create.png?raw=true)

* Click `Create`

* Launch your newly created Watson Studio Environment

### 2. Welcome to Watson Studio

IBM Watson Studio is a collaborative environment with AI tools that you and your team can use to collect and prepare training data, and to design, train, and deploy machine learning models.

Ranging from graphical tools you can use to build a model in minutes, to tools that automate running thousands of experiment training runs and hyperparameter optimization, Watson Studio AI tools support popular frameworks, including: TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and Keras.

You can think of Watson Studio AI tools in four categories:

* Visual recognition
* Natural language classification
* Machine learning
* Deep learning

* From the dashboard, click on `New Project` from the dashboard.

  ![](doc/source/images/new-project.png?raw=true)

* DSX projects depend on two services: Object Storage, and a Compute Engine.  If you don't already have Object Storage or a Compute Engine, you can create a new instance of each service while defining a new project.  The _New Project_ panel is easy to use, either select an existing service on the right, or create a new one.  In the example below services need to be created.

  ![](doc/source/images/create-services.png?raw=true)

> Note: Services created must be in the same region, and space, as your Data Science Experience service.

* Enter _Watson ML Integration_ as the project name and click `Create`.

* From within the new project `Overview` panel, click `Add to project` on the top right, selecting `Data asset`.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-to-project.png?raw=true)

  A panel on the right of the screen appears, select `load` and click on `Browse` to upload the data file you'll use to create a predictive model.

  ![](doc/source/images/add-data-asset.png?raw=true)

* On your machine, browse to the location of the file **patientdataV6.csv** in this repository in the **data/** directory. Select the file and click on Open (or the equivalent action for your operating system).

* Once successfully uploaded, the file should appear in the `Data Assets` section.

  ![](doc/source/images/data-assets.png?raw=true)

### 1. Deploy the testing application

Use Ctrl-click on the Deploy to `IBM Cloud` button below to open the deployment process in a separate tab.

  [![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/predictive-model-on-watson-ml)

> Note:  Make sure to deploy the application to the same region and space as where the *Watson Studio*, *Apache Spark* and *Cloud Object Storage* services will be created. Please take note of this space as later in this lab the Watson Machine Learning service needs to be deployed into the same space.

* Click on `Deploy` to deploy the application.

  ![](doc/source/images/pipeline.png?raw=true
)

* A Toolchain and Delivery Pipeline will be created for you to pull the app out of Github and deploy it in to IBM Cloud. Click on the Delivery Pipeline tile to see the status of the deployment.

  ![](doc/source/images/toolchain.png?raw=true)

* Wait for the **Deploy Stage** to complete successfully.

# Troubleshooting


# Privacy Notice
If using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button some metrics are tracked, the following
information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service
on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Application GUID (`application_id`)
* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` file in the sample application and the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove ``require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();`` from the ``app.js`` file in the top level directory.
